# MD5 Helper

This script is to calculate md5sum of a file. As we all very well know a script like this
would be pointless on Linux systems, since that calculation is as simple as typing `md5sum` on your terminal.
But unfortunately, sometimes we have to do things on Windows.

## Usage

1. Shift right-click on the file of which md5sum will be calculated.
2. Click on *Copy as path*.
3. Paste the copied path as the input argument, i.e run `python md5helper.py [path to your file]`
